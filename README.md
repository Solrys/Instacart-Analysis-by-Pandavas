# Machine Learning models
For our project, we will be using Unsupervised learning algorithms like K-means for customer segmentation and product segmentation. For Predictive analytics, we will be using deep learning Neural Networks. 
## K-Means for Customer Segmentation –
Our customers and Orders dataset would be merged for this analysis to group the customers into clusters based on characteristics of 
* Gender
* Age
* Income
* Customer_score
## K-Means for Product Segmentation –
We will be joining the product and orders dataset for this purpose, which would include characteristics such as-
* product_id
* dept_id
* aisle_id
* add_to_card_order
*  reordered_status
## Predictive analysis using Deep learning Neural network models.
Understanding retail industry can be tricky and evolving hence we will be using Deep Neural Networks for this purpose as many of the relationships between inputs and outputs are non-linear as well as complex.
