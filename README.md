## Introduction
Instacart is an American Company that operates a grocery delivery and pick-up service in the United States and Canada. The service allows customers to order groceries from participating retailers with the shopping being done by a personal shopper.

## Objective

The dataset chosen for analysis comprises of about 3 million grocery orders placed by around 200,000 customers. The goal is to predict purchasing patterns among these customers to be able to

•	Introduce new products in the market similar to the top selling products <br>
•	To boost sales by providing discounts on products that are frequently purchased<br>
•	To identify which products are least ordered or never re-ordered. With this analysis, the company would be able to reduce overhead costs incurred by carrying items that are less likely to be purchased<br>
•	Segment customers on their purchase frequency and recommend loyalty programs to each group of customers to increase sales.<br>
•	Which time of the day is the busiest for a particular product? A good understanding of this could help with the restocking time for the particular product<br>
